Implying that an assignment is\n            'simple' or 'basic' when someone has been having trouble is incredibly discouraging for them. Please do not\n            use these thoughtlessly.\n        If you have a usage, please read it through to make sure. These words aren't bad; they're just used\n            a lot.

It shows up consistently on some activities, inconsistently on others-- there's really no way to tell until you see it.\n        \n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                }\n            \n            On some assignments, this code snippet can cause a NoSuchElementException.\n        \n        \n        This isn't your fault. As far as I can tell, it happens when the Grader.java doesn't correctly send the test input to your code. However, there are some annoyingly esoteric ways to fix it.\n        \n        Try/Catch\n        try & catch tell Java to ignore specific errors. It's not good coding practice to use this too much, but for this problem, there's not much else you can do.\n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = \"\"; \n                    try {\n                        inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                    }\n                    catch(Exception e) {\n                    /* \n                    if you want to include some intelligent error handling, you can do that here.\n                        otherwise, just leave this block empty\n                    */\n                    }\n                }\n            \n            \n                Using try/catch will have the runtime ignore the error.\n                Note that the inputLine variable is declared outside the try. This makes sure it'll be accessible later in the method.\n        \n        \n        Scanner Checking Methods\n        The Scanner class includes some methods for when you can't be sure about the user's input. This is better practice, but doesn't work on CodeHS sometimes.\n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = \"\"; \n                    if(scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                        inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                    }\n                }\n            \n            \n                Using hasNextLine() to avoid the error.\n                Note that the inputLine variable is declared outside the if.

If you go further into the alphabet (e.g. Eve),\n                then they start to have special meanings-- 'Eve' is 'the eavesdropper'. In order to have more names and\n                to have a distinct feel\n                to DCT examples, I came up with Sam, Quin, Otis, and Elle.

Please do not\n            use these thoughtlessly.\n        If you have a usage, please read it through to make sure. These words aren't bad; they're just used\n            a lot.

That implies it's easy, when it might not be easy for\n                    some people. Either remove it, or make it more clear using 'only' (\"This assignment\n                    only wants you to print out the array\").\n            \n            \n                \"Only\"\n                Depending on context, this can imply the same things as 'just'.

It\n                    may not be 'without difficulty' for someone reading, and they may be discouraged if it is.\n            \n            \n                \"Basically\"\n                \n                    It may not be 'basic' for your reader.\n                \n            \n            \n                \"Easily\"\n                It may not be 'easy' for your reader.\n            \n            \n                \"Of course\"\n                It might not be self-evident for your reader.\n            \n        \n        Advanced Features\n        Markdown!!!\n        Want formatting in your annotations?

To aid with those, here are some easy solutions.\n        \n            NoSuchElementException\n        \n    ","address":"/error-almanac/index"},{"title":"NoSuchElementException on CodeHS","text":"\n    NoSuchElementException on CodeHS\n        \n        NoSuchElementException is an error typically caused by the Scanner class. It shows up consistently on some activities, inconsistently on others-- there's really no way to tell until you see it.\n        \n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                }\n            \n            On some assignments, this code snippet can cause a NoSuchElementException.\n        \n        \n        This isn't your fault. As far as I can tell, it happens when the Grader.java doesn't correctly send the test input to your code. However, there are some annoyingly esoteric ways to fix it.\n        \n        Try/Catch\n        try & catch tell Java to ignore specific errors. It's not good coding practice to use this too much, but for this problem, there's not much else you can do.\n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = \"\"; \n                    try {\n                        inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                    }\n                    catch(Exception e) {\n                    /* \n                    if you want to include some intelligent error handling, you can do that here.\n                        otherwise, just leave this block empty\n                    */\n                    }\n                }\n            \n            \n                Using try/catch will have the runtime ignore the error.\n                Note that the inputLine variable is declared outside the try. This makes sure it'll be accessible later in the method.\n        \n        \n        Scanner Checking Methods\n        The Scanner class includes some methods for when you can't be sure about the user's input. This is better practice, but doesn't work on CodeHS sometimes.\n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = \"\"; \n                    if(scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                        inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                    }\n                }\n            \n            \n                Using hasNextLine() to avoid the error.\n                Note that the inputLine variable is declared outside the if. This makes sure it'll be accessible later in the method.\n        \n        \n        Combining Solutions\n        If you're still having the error or your code isn't working the way it's supposed to, try combining both solutions. This is a bit overkill, but it shows your teacher that you know both the proper solution and the practical one!\n        \n            \n                public static void main(String[] args) {\n                    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n                    \n                    String inputLine = \"\"; \n                    try {\n                        if(scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                            inputLine = scanner.nextLine();\n                        }\n                    }\n                    //this time, i just left the `catch` block empty\n                    catch(Exception e) {}\n                }\n            \n            \n                Combining try/catch with hasNextLine() to avoid the error.\n        \n    ","address":"/error-almanac/NoSuchElementException"},{"title":"Fair Use","text":"\n        Fair Use\n\n        \n            This site is for educational purposes only.
