<h2><a></a>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</h2>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and<br />
    conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share<br />
    original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright<br />
    and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The<br />
    following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not<br />
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are<br />
        intended for use by those authorized to give the public<br />
        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by<br />
        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are<br />
        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms<br />
        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.<br />
        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before<br />
        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the<br />
        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any<br />
        material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-<br />
        licensed material, or material used under an exception or<br />
        limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:<br />
        <a>wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</a></li>
    <li>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public<br />
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the<br />
        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If<br />
        the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for<br />
        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to<br />
        copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our<br />
        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain<br />
        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of<br />
        the licensed material may still be restricted for other<br />
        reasons, including because others have copyright or other<br />
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,<br />
        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.<br />
        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to<br />
        respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations<br />

                <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br />
                    the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br />
                    non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br />
                    exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
                <p>a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br />
                    in part; and</p>

            <li>
                <p>Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br />
                    Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br />
                    License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br />
                    its terms and conditions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br />

                    all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br />
                    and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br />

                    authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br />
                    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br />
                    technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br />
                    Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br />
                    simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br />
                    (4) never produces Adapted Material.</p>

                    any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br />
                    apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br />
                    Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br />

                    the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br />
                    assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br />
                    extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br />

                    Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br />
                    under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br />
                    licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br />

            Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br />
            this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br />
            terminate automatically.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br />
            Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br />
                    it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br />
                    violation; or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br />
            right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br />
            of this Public License.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br />
            Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br />
            distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br />
            will not terminate this Public License.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br />
            License.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3><a></a>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br />
            terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br />
            Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br />
            independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
    </li>

<h3><a></a>Section 8 – Interpretation.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br />
            shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br />
            conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br />
            be made without permission under this Public License.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br />
            deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br />
            minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br />
            cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br />
            without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br />
            conditions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br />
            failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br />
            Licensor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br />
            as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br />
            that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br />
            processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
